The provided Python code defines a simple library management system encapsulated within the "Library" class. This class enables users to interactively add new books to the library, view the total number of books, and persistently store and load the library information from a text file named "library.txt". The class initializes with an empty list of books and a counter for the total number of books, automatically loading any existing library data from the text file upon instantiation. The methods within the class facilitate the addition of new books, display the complete list of books with ordinal positions, and ensure the persistent storage of the library information. Users can seamlessly integrate this class into their projects to manage a basic book catalog. The provided example at the end demonstrates the usage of the class by creating an instance, adding books interactively, displaying the book list, and showcasing the total number of books in the library.
